            <p>I'm an amateur cosplayer, my first and best cosplay was of Ryu from the Street Fighter series the year he was introduced into Smash Bros. 
              I went to Pax in the picture above and I was challenged about 15 times by other Smash Characters... 9 of them were Links</p>
              <p>I am currently studying at RMIT in a Bachelor of Information Technology and working part-time as a Data Operator. 
                In my spare time I love reading fiction, watching anime and crime serials and playing Final Fantasy XIV online (Background picture).</p>

        <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
        <div class="p2">
        <p>I have always been technology inclined, whether it would be for gaming, peculiar gadgets or scientific advancements, 
          I would try to get my hands on a device to explore its capabilities. It was during my time in high school when delving into my school’s email 
          software that I picked up my coding interest and started using Python to send automated emails. I enrolled in my school’s extracurricular IT 
          class after school.</p>
        <p>RMIT’s information technology course is a suitable fit for my career path, as I am currently working part-time in data operations at a bank. 
          I had originally been studying Engineering and Commerce at Monash but found that its curriculum wasn’t compatible with my interests or my schedule. 
          RMIT’s flexible online approach as well as its more technology inclined reputation garnered my interest and then my acceptance as a much more 
          suitable course for my education.</p>
        <p>In the course of my studies, I hope to expand my skills in software development for multiple types of systems, such as data engineering, 
          communication or even cyber security. Knowing how to construct a database, maintain high traffic and density servers for live services or even 
          being able create websites are skills that I would love to learn. Having experiences and aptitudes in these areas can help me be more desirable 
          to high-tech employers with promising opportunities for my career, which would be a comfortable assurance for my future.</p>

        <p></p>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>My current ideal job is formed from my current experiences and skills I have developed in data management, a Data Operations Manager. 
            In brief, the role organises how information is shared, stored and disseminated for a company’s use. The person in this position determines how 
            these systems operate, whether that means organising the intranet that data can be securely shared on, choosing what platforms will be implemented 
            to use or even writing software help present information in a neat manner. Every service in the present age requires some form of data management 
            and storage. From payments to product details, no company that wants to succeed will go without someone storing and organising information, which 
            is why I believe a job of Data Operations Manager will never be without demand.</p>
          <p>A Data Operations Manager should have intimate knowledge of database structures and information distribution systems. While being able to build 
            databases using software by ones’ self would be undoubtably useful for the position, the actual requirements realistically be having the capability 
            to use the database and be able to manage the system to read from it so all required personnel can access it.</p>
          <p>I have been processing and consolidating data into readable forms such as html graphs and excel files from different platforms of databases using 
            languages such as SQL and python. To reach my ideal role as a Data Operations Manager I believe I require more experience in developing the distribution 
            system, software for accessibility for employees to extract the data they need for tasks. Ideally, interning under a database development company to 
            learn how to maintain and build such a system would teach me the skills required, Teradata or IBM would be the most desired companies.</p>

          <p>The Myers-Briggs 16 Personalities test has judged me to have a diplomatic, turbulent mediator personality, meaning I prefer to cooperate than compete 
            with my peers and that I do not define personal success with concrete measurements such as a high salary or awards, which I consider ironic since I 
            specialise in data analytics. As a visual learner, according to the Educator Planner Learning style test, I will optimally study with visual aids explaining 
            concepts rather than just reading about the concept with text only. Videos, diagrams and live demonstrations are ideal learning tools for me. 
            Truity’s Big Five Personality test indicates that in most scenarios I am open with my thoughts when asked but will often keep them to myself if I not 
            prompted to. I am more inclined to cooperation than challenging peers and be easily stressed by negative emotions.</p>
          <p>The results of these tests deem that my attitude towards teamwork will be a mediatory one, I will be inclined to defuse any conflicts that cause emotional 
            stress between team members reach the goals amicably. My strengths in a team setting would be taking charge if a consensus cannot be reached without 
            seemingly trying to hold onto a leadership position but instead just allow the group to move on with its progress until a general direction can be agreed 
            upon. If tensions linger for too long, I may be subject to frustration or withdraw from group activities due to my turbulent nature, as empathy can be a 
            disadvantage in conflicting situations. </p>

        <!-- Project Idea -->
        <h2>Project - General Practice via Remote Electronic Proxy (GP-REP)</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>The title for my assignment project is General Practice via Remote Electronic Proxy, or GP-REP for short. It is a system of compact aerial drones that act 
            as both a communication device for a doctor and a delivery mechanism of tests for patients in remote communities to have access to regular healthcare from a 
            doctor if there are no medical practitioners in the area. As an example, a patient in a rural town where the closest doctor is a city more than 400km away 
            may not be able to have a check-up due to job constraints or the nature of their illness, an appointment can be made with a doctor using a drone to administer 
            diagnosis by instructions from the doctor a general diagnosis kit the drone carries. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>While the concept of medical delivery via drones is not new, the drones currently in use are designed more for specific procedures and collecting samples 
            for lab tests, usually with the doctor already on scene for equipment use or back in the lab to run tests. My project idea centres around using a drone system 
            for live, non-emergency check-ups to maintain one’s health for those who can’t attend an appointment in person. Over the past few years, due to a global pandemic, 
            those stuck inside have missed regular appointments for the sake of safety while risking undetected problems. Using virtual conferences to substitute physical 
            appointments means that the consultation won’t have the benefit of diagnostic tests that can be done in person. The proposed drone system should as an online 
            clinic to give consultation without losing as much utility.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>The GP-REP would be comprised of two primary systems. The first is the medical appointment system; to create and store medical records of patients for their 
            designated practitioner, book appointments and assign what kind appointment it would be (i.e., short or long, diagnostic or routine check-up, etc). This is a 
            simple doctors’ network, not unlike the current secretarial structure for clinics and hospitals. A key difference would be the entry for an appointment address, 
            as it will determine several statistical queries needed for the drone system to work such as the distance from the nearest drone launch site and the feasibility 
            of a proxy check-up if the address is not in a suitable environment.</p>
          <p>The second system pertains to the aerial drones, as they are the foundation of what makes this project idea achievable. The drones must be equipped several 
            information technology devices for practical medical use, such as a communication system consisting of cameras and microphones to facilitate doctor-patient 
            contact, navigation software and sensors to determine flight path, inventory cataloguing to check manifests of medicinal items that will be delivered and/or 
            brought back and environment sensors to take data of the area of the appointment to decide whether or not it is clean enough to do a test.</p>
          <p>A medical proxy appointment would be carried out thusly; first a booking would be made online on a website representing the network of doctors who agreed to 
            participate in the GP-REP system. The patient will fill out the usual medical appointment details with the addition of the address where the medical exam would 
            be intended to take place. The address entry would be compared to the database of general practice clinics and return a list of available doctors sorted by closest 
            distance first. Assuming a patient decides on which doctor they will make an appointment with and the date and time, the details are saved in both the clinic’s 
            booking system and the drones’ system.</p>
          <p>The drones can be launched from either directly from the clinic of the chosen doctor or a storage facility dedicated to maintaining and equipping the drones for 
            medical purposes. When the appointment time nears the drone’s information system will notify staff of appropriate adjustments to be made to the drone for the proxy 
            consultation, whether it would be specific medical tests to be loaded onto the drone’s carry-on compartment or adjusting the drone’s blades if the weather at the 
            time is predicted to have strong winds.</p>
          <p>GPS navigation will then direct the drone to the designated address and the appointment will take place after it arrives and the patient takes it to a private 
            setting. Camera and microphone communication will allow the consultation between the doctor and patient to take place and instructions can be given verbally on how 
            to use any test kits delivered or medical measuring equipment the drone has attached. Once the appointment has concluded the call, test kit data and any other 
            relevant information is stored on the system before the drone is directed back to its place of origin and stored for reuse.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>Various mark-up languages can be used to write the online registration website to facilitate the booking system, since Intro into Information Technology teaches 
            HTML in its first few courses it would be an ideal start to write up the website if it. For the storage of patient and doctor information the programs required can 
            be written in Python and stored via the Pandas modules. While there are drones that can deliver medicine via parachute such as the Zipline™ drones, the required 
            drones actually land and be transported for online consultation. Such hardware would require a capability to lift a few kilograms for both test kits and equipment. 
            Amazon Prime Air’s model of drone has not only this weight bearing capability, but also inbuilt GPS guidance.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Skills Required</h3>
        <p>Programming language writing skills – Python, HTML <br>
          GPS software experience <br>
          Drone maintenance skills <br>
          </p>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>Python programming would require several months of tutoring and practice to obtain the level of skill to create a sufficient data storage system as well a GPS 
            navigation for the drones. The drone hardware will be harder to obtain the skills to maintain as it will require specialist hardware knowledge of not only drones 
            but also aerial transportation, training and acquisition of the drones will be expensive.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <div class="p2">
          <p>GP-REP could expand the reach of regular healthcare to rural town areas and those who are separated due to lockdowns or covid isolations. Even after the pandemic 
            ends it will allow online consultations with doctors to be more productive with the introduction of mobile medical tests instead of video chat only. Accessibility 
            to online services increase consumer traffic across all services, even in medicine; thus GP-REP would be a huge improvement in distributing healthcare for a wider 
            audience. Improvements made to mobile medicinal practices can increase diagnosis rates and clinic capabilities.</p>
